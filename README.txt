This is the main readme for Warhammer-Complete.
For now, the project is using the Chaos-Complete.dm file. Do not activate Warhammer Complete to play this mod. The 3 Chaos nations are in the modpack now, and functional. Other nations have been removed, as their creators will be porting most of them. As for the others, I may reintegrate them at some point. Enjoy.
That is all. Thanks to anyone who chooses to work on this project with me - let's make Warhammer great again!
