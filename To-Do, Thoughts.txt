To-Do - Main Tasks:
1. New Dark Elves?
2. Fix Altdorf's starting army, right now it's Marignon's. - done. Also fixed PD.
3. Compatibility - Summod

Thoughts/Less Urgent:

Chaos:
Look at screamers and flamers
Look at commanders' chaosrec.

Dwarfs:
Dwarf Pretender, Brother of War, is too powerful (6 paths, 80 point cost), move to autocost minus something.
And their Ancient King pretender is too expensive.

TKs:
Shit
Immortals desc says they have upkeep but they don't
Necropolis Knights say they're riding horses but are riding yellow things
Overall limited pret choice
First King has Holy 4, probly to summon Immortals. Remove the Holy, give a summon allies and look at cost.

Tzeentch:
Pretty limited pretender choice, not terrible tho

Nurgle:
Same

Khorne:
Needs a ton of help, but pretender choice is shit and Lord of the End Times pretender should probably be revised

Morka:
Still has the Face of Gork

Dark Elves:
Witch King supposedly has a retinue but it isn't there

Skaven:
Pretty limited pret choice, though they have 3 custom ones.

VCs:
Pretty limited pret choice, no discounts for e.g. Vamp Queen
Cultist doesn't have a holy path, probly simple bug

Lizardmen:
Seems they have a very limited unit recruitment list...check and make sure nothing else should be there.
