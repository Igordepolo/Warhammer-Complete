The Marksmen are not State Troops and lack the discipline and armour of State crossbowmen, but none can argue with their effectiveness at range.

Many a foe has closed to melee seeking to escape volley after volley of deadly accurate crossbow fire only to find themselves dashed on a wall of steel. The Ironsides are given the best equipment available to the Arsenal and are heavily armoured, though being neither noble nor in the direct service of an Elector Count they have no access to the finest dwarf-forged full plate of the Greatswords or Knightly Orders."

Equipped with deadly two-handed swords and superbly crafted suits of full plate armour made by Dwarf Smiths, Greatswords are a powerful elite. They are notoriously stubborn and brave soldiers and many are the tales of them protecting their Count to the very last man."

#descr "The Reiksguard are the personal troops of the Emperor himself, with their Grand Master the Reiksmarshall swearing direct allegiance to the Emperor rather than Empire or province. The Reiksguard Order is split into two distinct fighting forces; the famed Reiksguard Knights and the less numerous Reiksguard Foot. The primary duty of the Foot is to protect the palace of the Emperor, but sometimes units of these elite heavy infantry are known to leave the palace and war further afield, particularly if the Emperor is leading a military Campaign. Members of the Reiksguard Foot are traditionally not inducted into the Inner Circle of the Order, as their loyalty must always be to the Emperor above all else."

#spr2 "./Warhammer-Complete/Hero_Ludwig2.tga"
#name "Champion of the Emperor"
#descr "Ludwig Schwarzhelm is the Champion of Karl Franz, a towering figure of a man, renowned throughout the Empire for his mighty physique, impressive beard and stern expression. He is said to have never smiled in his life. His role is to uphold the Emperor's justice during trials of combat. Such trials are a judicial right of high ranking noblemen accused of breaking the Emperor's laws. Ludwig is also the Emperor's bodyguard and his mere presence has so far proven enough to discourage any attempts on the Emperor's life. On the battlefield Ludwig wields the unerring Sword of Justice and carries aloft the Emperor's personal standard. Though Ludwig is no tactician and gives no rousing speeches, the knowledge that he is watching spurs men under his command to feats of bravery. To date Ludwig Schwarzhelm has never been defeated."

#name "Master of the Bright College"

#descr "Every seven years, the Masters of the eight magical colleges in Altdorf enter a contest of magical might to decide which of them will reign as the Supreme Patriarch for the next seven years. This is an important decision, because the Winds of Magic will blow strongly for the college which supplies the Supreme Patriarch. Thyrus Gormann, Master of the Bright College, held this postition for many years, before being usurped by a young Gold Mage of extraordinary power named Balthasar Gelt. He has taken his loss well and sworn loyalty to the Patriarch, but his fiery nature ensures he will be first amongst the challengers in the next meeting. As a fire mage, Gormann is unsurpassed in the Old World."

--spr2 "./Warhammer-Complete/Hero Luthor2.tga"
#name "Voice of Sigmar"

#descr "Luthor Huss first came to the attention of the Empire when he roused a small village against a large warband of Beastmen and successfully beat them back, slaying many with his great hammer. When a relief force arrived to defend the village, Huss pursued the Warband alone, tracking them and single handedly taking the head of their Shaman leader. Huss rose to prominence in his order and was chosen to represent the Warrior Priests in the Sigmarite Council in Altdorf. Here Huss first confronted the Arch Lectors and accused them of corruption; an act resulting in his dismissal. Since that day Huss has travelled the Empire smiting evil and inspiring the people with his great speeches. In battle Huss is surrounded by an aura of spiritual power and as he travels through the lands of the faithful he inevitably attracts crazed flagellants."

#descr "The University of Altdorf is second only to the the University of Nuln in size and has benefitted greatly from the crowning of Emperor Karl Franz, himself a scholar and philosopher of some merit. Though their goals are rather different the University works closely with the Imperial School of Engineers and at times even the Bright, Grey and Gold Colleges. The University is closely monitored by both the Colleges of Magic and the Sigmarite Faith, for many is the bright young scholar or frustrated academic who has in the past pursued knowledge not meant for mortals and strayed into the world of dark arcana or heresy. Consequently Scholars of Altdorf are more restricted in their studies than those of the University of Nuln. Scholars are neither Wizards nor Engineers, but their knowledge of chemistry, mathematics and philosophy makes them excellent researchers."

Here the mysteries of the world are unravelled and new theories and technologies devised, some of which are taken up with gusto by the Engineers of the Imperial Arsenal. The University of Nuln has a long standing rivalry with that of Altdorf and in recent years have extricated itself further from the grip of Sigmarite dogma. This has sparked talk of possible heresy within the walls of the institution, but Countess Emmanuelle von Liebwitz of Nuln has rebuffed all Sigmarite probes in this matter as a threat to her authority.

The Imperial Arsenal at Ulm has only a handful of Steam Tanks operational at any given time, for these are complex and unreliable creations. The furnace and boiler at the heart of the tank produce an incredible heat which radiates to the surrounding area and as such the Tank is dangerous to friend and foe alike. If the Steam Tank becomes sufficiently damaged the engineer in charge will switch from simply rolling over the foe to venting great jets of super-heated steam. This is an effective weapon but unreliable and hazardous to the Tank itself, not to mention any nearby Imperial troops."

#descr "The Wizards of the Grey Order study the Lore of Shadow, Fifth Lore of Magic, the Wind of Ulgu. The symbol of the Fifth Lore is the Sword of Judgement and the colour of the Order's garb is grey. Of all the Orders they are the most secretive and are greatly feared by common men, for it is known they watch all from the shadows and wander the breadth of the land. A Wizard Lord of the Grey College is a master of stealth, misdirection and the shadows with the patience and focus to strike when least expected. Mounted on steeds rumoured to be descended from High Elven breeds and enchanted with Shadow Magic, they may move unseen through the lands and across battlefields at impossible speeds. Many a grave foe has fallen unseen by the hand of a Shadow Lord."

The wind of Hysh is the purest amongst the Lores, though it is also the most effusive and difficult to master. Because of this, comparatively few Light Wizards ever earn the title of Wizard Lord. Those that do are true masters of the arcane who have begun to understand the nature of magic itself and can bend Light energy itself to reproduce facets of the other Lores. This focus on demanding study leaves the Lords physically weak, but at the head of a Communion of Light, they are powerful indeed."

Typically operating in small groups to track Beastmen Warbands, the Hunters are expert woodsmen and can always rely on the support of the populace who appreciate such mighty warriors stooping to defend even the smallest villages. The nature of their mission means Hunters' equipment is often worn from travel and lacking the services of blacksmiths, they often discard pieces of armour damaged in skirmishes. Lances need to be replaced too often and swords become dull and rusted, so the Hunters prefer to use heavier and more reliable axes."

---- Contact Jade Wizard

--newspell
--name "Contact Jade Wizard"
--description "The Wizards of the Jade Order study the Lore of Life, the Third Lore, the wind of Ghyran. The symbol of the Third Lore is the spiralling coil of life and the colour of the Order's robes is green. The magical energies of Ghyran precipitate like rain upon the earth and is drawn up into plants of all forms. Jade Wizards prefer the company of nature over civilisation, though they are not so isolationist as the Amber Order. Jade Wizards can command the elemental forces of nature itself, with some specialising in rain and storms, while others manipulate the very earth itself. They are also expert herbalists and healers outside of battle."

Often turning their abilities to the prevention of natural disasters and healing of the people, they have been recognised as miracle workers and are sacred."
