-- TO-DO
-- THOUGHTS
-- Different kinds of spawn for ascension. Will need lots if you want different types normally
-- Really, ideally you'd have lesser champions with greater chances of spawndom than lords
-- Could use montags for daemonic gifts on princes/greater daemons
-- Put something in description for chaos warriors about multiple attacks
-- There's also dt_raise - see if it can work
-- Do daemon aura for Tzeentch (Nurgle has one already)
-- Consider de-magicking champions for N and Tz, make sure sorc lineups are ok
-- Add pretenders, check existing pretender costs
-- Remove retinues from most daemons
-- Effect 44 is transformation - way to give Tzeentch a transform spell? Ascend commander?
	Would probably be best only for chosen lords, + make it easier for lords to lvl up
	Story events for ascention? Doesn't take up spell space...

-- Consider armor rework - forgeable Chaos Armor different from the normal one
-- Probably best to just give people normal chain/plate at that point
-- Would restore unremovable and maybe bless, also increase prot and decrease enc, -def
-- Would have to remove light chaos armor too, probly

-- SPRITES
-- 1.5x-2x size of major daemons
-- See if there's a way to turn an image into a pixellated version
Probly use new Nurgle sprite

-- BALANCE/TESTING
Make chaos spear for Slaanesh Lord and Chosen Lord
Make daemon auras affect friendlies - but then it'll affect THEM too...
Add plague carrier to Nurgle's Greater Daemons, maybe remove from pestigor
Add daemonhood event
Consider costs of N and Tz's daemons
Look at consistency btwn warrior lines, esp. in hp, strength, att and def.
Same for daemons - likely needs rework.
Also fix gors and ungors to be in line with Slaan's
Should there be leveled up prophetshapes?
Event testing - test with dom levels
Test aura of Tzeentch, Bliss in Torment
Test that foreignrecs aren't too good
Test Tz's spells for OP-ness
Test daemons for cost-effectiveness
Test chaosrecs while playing
Test expansion for all - esp. Tzeentch and weird blessings
Test stupid daemonettes attack city spell, remove if stupid
Change descriptions for cultist (re events) and lords (re Chosen transformation)
Consider removing chosen lord from hero lineup:
	Would have to see if you can rebalance other hero appear rates
Currently spawns are heroes (at least for Nurgle). Fix w/cultist and ascend events
Minor Chaos Fury nerfs and daemonette summon buff
Nerfed nurglings - they had invuln 15, not have invuln 5 and Great Unclean Ones summon more.
Misc description fixes

AURA WORK:
Auras are now included in each Chaos faction. Quick summary:
Tzeentch - does damage on easy MR negates check
Nurgle - causes disease on easy MR negates check
Slaanesh - fatigue damage on normal MR check
They will likely require future adjustments for balance, but this version works.

To-Do
-- Add Chaos Dwarfs god
-- Add a 'Mechanics' line to most nations, a la Chaos Dwarfs
-- Balance Skaven - start by improving the summons, decreasing lab costs to 300?
-- Increase cost of lizard summons? Then again, their infrastructure is quite bad.
-- Special feature file? Would describe events/weird mechanics

-- Increase att/def skill a bit for some Daemons
-- Remove priest levels from Slaanesh sorc line
-- Switch paths on Keeper of Secrets and Daemon Princess - Princess would have more magic

Version 1.4:
-- Added Chaos Dwarfs!
--  Changed in-game name to "Chaos Dwarfs"
--  Added Master Daemonsmith pretender - solid rainbow chassis
--  Buffed infernal guard: made sacred, reclimit 1->2
--  Buffed slave giant (same changes as to Ogre Kingdoms' slave giant)
--  Changed cap income to 2 fire, 1 earth, 1 death, and 3 blood
--  Slave cost increased from 5 to 6, slave upkeep added at roughly half value, rpcost 9->6
--  Added a slave contract weapon, "Varies", for cosmetic reasons

--	Changed in-game name from "Goldtooth Tribe" to "Ogre Kingdoms"
-- Added a god: Facet of the Maw. Based on Dom3+4 Facet of the Maw summon - B2N1 immobile
--  Added some events revolving around a new site - a smaller version of the Maw Pit
--	  10% chance of spawning the Pit in a fort, it allows recruitment of Pitfighters and gives 3 slaves/turn
--    Other events for destroying it when an enemy takes the fort, and a 25% chance of reopening/turn if retaken
--  Forts 50% more expensive, not 100
--  Pitfighters otherwise cap-only and description updated
--	Reduced unit costs across the board - basic ogre is now 25 gold, not 30
--	Added snowmove and increased coldres to 5 on most units
--	Removed ambidextrous from most units to reduce clutter, compensated stat-wise
--  Increased gem income to standard for MA (2 blood slaves = 1 gem)
--	Increased starting army size from 12 to 20
--  Reworked research levels to be more spread out, correspond more to power level

--	Buffed slave giant (300->200 gold, 5->10 fear, removed cap-only limit, increased siege bonus)
--  Buffed Mawgut and Mawfiend - less popkill and recuperation on the first, blood vengeance and another claw on the second
--	Minor fixes:
--	 No Ogre Tyrant helmet, less ammo on Harpoon, mawtribe +morale, fixed slave giant helmet, fixed costs
-- Added more pretenders to Ogre Kingdoms and Skaven selection

Version 1.3:
-- Added Skaven!
--   Small bugfixes on their pretenders (minor cost changes mostly, fixed slots on the Pillar)
--   Decreased chances of warpstone seam events - they were too damaging
-- Added Lizardmen!
--    Changed their in-game name to 'Lizardmen' (was Itza) and fixed a crash caused by a typo

-- Added Nurgle Daemon Prince summon, Great Unclean One now Conj 9
-- Overhauled Great Unclean One - new magic paths
-- Increased magic on Tzeentch Daemon Prince summon
-- Changed some research levels and magic path reqs for greater Tzeentch and Nurgle summons
-- Tzeentch+Nurgle priest rework - exalted champ and lord now have holy levels.
-- Event Rework - sorc unit spawns are now forsaken, no culting other Chaos factions, 1 spawn/event, worse spawns

--   Increased PD limit to stop cultist events - now 20 PD for SL and TZ and 25 for NU

--Version 1.25: Description changes, wastesurvival, snowmove and some Daemon work
--Changed descriptions to be much clearer about nation capabilities
--Removed mountain survival from most human units - waste survival is enough, and Chaos moves slowly
--Eliminated most Nurgle invuln, compensated with more health and some regen on greater daemons
--Lowered Tzeentch invuln values on lesser daemons and chosen by 5; raised by 5 on chaos lord and daemon prince
--Added wastesurvival and snowmove to most daemons, they won't slow the armies any more
--Added recuperation to most heroes and all Nurgle daemons
--Changes to latehero values - some had latehero added, some minor adjustments to keep early expansion balanced
--Limited sailing - now marauder chieftains are limited to 40 size 2 guys
--Removed pillage bonus from forsaken - they're too crazy to do much of anything effectively
--Misc changes to beastmen prot values - gors generally went from 4 to 6
--Slight nerf to Tzeentch summon screamer spell - 8 instead of 9 units

--Version 1.21: Nurgle Aura Fix
--Now Nurgle's disease auras are negated by an easy MR check. Keeps armies from always getting diseased after a single battle with Nurgle
--Also, fixed Tzeentch's Greater Aura - wasn't working
--Couple misc changes

-- Version 1.2: Bugs and Balancings
--Fixed events - cult form events require a cultist, 40 unrest and chaos 1. 40% chance for SL, 20% for TZ and NU
-- NU reqs 50 unrest, chaos 1, magic 1, 50 unrest -- more powerful event

Version .91 , .92 and .93
(Not an exhaustive list, I likely missed a few things)
Various bugfixes
Added better daemonic names to Tzeentch, Nurgle and Khorne
Added #latehero of various times to Slaanesh and Tzeetch's heroes
Nerfed some of these heroes when OP
Commented out mercs - they're not working at all right now.
Decreased cost of Greater Tribute to Order to 1400


Version .8
Llama's new Tomb Kings and Vampire Counts are in!
Fixed bugs in Vampire Counts as reported on the forums
Added domunrest 2 to VC because Llama definitely wants domunrest but forgot to add it.
2 is a placeholder, seems reasonable but we'll see.
Also fixed some miscellaneous bugs.


Version .72 (.71 was Slaanesh changes)
-- Nurgle's diseaseres completely redone. Most humans now have some disease vulnerability, but daemons are immune.
	Previously, some humans were immune, some humans and most daemons had low or no diseaseres.
	UPDATE: Doh. Daemons had no diseaseres because they aren't affected by disease. Re-removed it.
-- Nurgle and Tzeentch sorcerers autocalced from 125 gold, also removed adept researcher.

Version .70 - Still JoanSam
-- Lots more miscellaneous changes...woundfend fixes for orcs and...maybe some wood elves? Set the value to 50,
   since there's no way to know what they wanted. Thought I had already done these a while ago...maybe I lost the version somewhere.
   Yeah, just lots of miscellaneous bug fixes highlighted by the inspector. The errors it shows now should just be new modding commands.
-- Wood Elf multihero crash should be fixed. The multiheroes were just copystats of other units, 
   so they were deleted and the units themselves are now recruitable and multiheroes.
-- Updated Dark Elves and High Elves to Deathjester's recent versions.
-- Slaanesh changes in their own changelog.
-- Chaos weaponry and armor standardized, condensed to Slaanesh versions where possible. This changes a LOT.
-- Costs changed for Chaos Warriors (20 -> 30), Chaos Knights (50 -> 60) and Chosen (50 -> 65, Slaanesh 60 cause they have no special abilities.)
-- Empire full plate removed, replaced with vanilla full plate. Vanilla plate has 2 more enc but is 5 res cheaper.
-- Skaven Moulder Packmaster now summons 3 rats instead of 9 rats and 3 Maharishi...no idea why that was happening.
-- Skaven starting army was 60 slaves and 30 clanrats, now 30 and 20 respectively.
-- Crashes caused by Dark Elf flag and initiate and High Elf flag, archer, and spearman sprites fixed.
-- Screamers summon spell now summons 9 instead of 10 screamers, they also have non-AP weapons now.
-- Chaos battleaxe (used by Tzeentch's shieldless Chosen) no longer AP but has 2 attacks, res cost increased by 1.
-- TK skeletons commented out, normal skellies should be summoned from now on.
-- Flames of Tzeentch no longer AoE 1, now single target. Flames and Lightning have 20 ammo from 50.
-- Bite attack removed from Chaos Furies of Tzeentch and Nurgle.


Version .62
JoanSam's Slaanesh changes detailed in the relevant section of the .dm
Also removed the 'warhorse hoof' weapon and just replaced them with hooves. Only did 1 more damage anyway.

Courtesy of Zonk:
* All fixed cost pretenders switched to autocalc+0 and #cheapgod20. 
Many will need cost adjustements to account for abilities autocalc can't account for, such as #onebattlespell, but it's a start. Please report any unreasonable costs.
* Pretenders with MR < 18 and morale < 30 raised to that, except for Avatar of Horus who only got MR 14->16 (still fits his description, but less crippling)
* #makemonsterX -> #makemonstersX (so commanders meant to summon allies actually can)
* Skaven #cavenation 2 (will always start in caves in possible, previously it was 1 so 'can start in caves')
* Removed many obsolete or redundant pretenders, commands and comments, Orcs' Warpaint and Shadow King's Stone 'armor' (they did nothing, so waste of slots).
* Enabled pretenders for 
Wood Elves : Irminsul, Nature Dragon, Lord of the Wild, Volla of the Bountiful Forest, Idol of Beasts, Bitch Queen
Sylvania : Fountain of Blood, Vampire Queen, Demilich, Prince of Death, Statue of the Underworld, Master Lich, Dracolich, Raven of 
the Underworld, Linnormr, Bog Mummy, Frost Father, Bitch Queen, Ghost King
Tomb Kings : Master Lich, Demilich, Lich Queen, Prince of Death, Ghost King, Neter of the Underworld, Statue of the Underworld, Sphinx
* Light Wizard Lord: healer 20->2

Version .61

(Slaanesh changes in the relevant section of the .dm, this was 1.05 I believe) - JoanSam

Zonk:

NULN & ALTDORF
* Priest MR: Initiate of Sigmar 10->13, Warrior Priest 10->14, Arch Lector 10->15

* Flagellant: mor 30->20 (30 means they completely ignore morale effects even when not berserk, which seems excessive)

* Arch Lector MR 10->15 (+1 over Warrior Priest)

* Jade Wizard healer 20->2 & springpower 1->10, Jade Wizard Lord healer 60->5 & springpower 50->25 (healer was % to heal troops in province in Dom3, springpower is a negative -% HP in fall so more isn't always better)

* Removed obsolete lines in .dm referencing Dom3 forts

* Extra blank lines in #summary so it formats properly.

* Altdorf can now recruit the correct units

? Warrior Priest has two costs (100 in recruited form, 80 in tranformed). Inteded, to have a lower upkeep, or to give lower upkeep, or mistake?

? Moot Militia: Uses Short Bows, size 1 units usually use Small Bows instead. This would be a huge nerf however (damage 9->6, range 30->20, ammo 12->8) and make them nearly useless.

? The stronger forestshape of Amber Wizards does not have separate Altdorf & Nuln versions, and so always turns back to the Nuln one. This can be fixed by creating a new unit, or we can accept the 10 gold difference and save an unit ID.


Version .60 -JoanSam
Slaanesh changes in changelog
Orcs - Added Face of Mork - same sprite as Face of Gork, but now Morka doesn't have to worship Gork.
Chaos - Chosen of Tzeentch and Nurgle reclimit 5 removed. Gold cost decreased from 60 to 50.
